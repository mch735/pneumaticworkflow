# Pneumatic: All Workflows all the Time




**Pneumatic** is an open-source SaaS workflow management system designed to streamline and organize workflows in businesses of any size. Originally developed as a cloud-based platform, Pneumatic empowers teams by enabling them to set up, run, and optimize workflows collaboratively, tracking each stage as tasks move from team to team.

## Key Features

**Workflow Templates:** Create custom workflow templates and reuse them for repetitive processes. Templates define a series of steps that can be used across multiple workflows.

**Multi-Workflow Management:** Once templates are set, create multiple workflows from each template and run them in parallel, adapting them as needed.

**Task Buckets for Staff:** Pneumatic focuses on individual task management, giving each staff member their own bucket of tasks. Staffers can complete tasks efficiently by emptying their buckets one by one.
